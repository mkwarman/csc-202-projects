CHANGELOG:

Version 1.7
	Added comments
	Better optimized some sections of code
	Possibility eliminated some bugs preliminarily

Version 1.6
	Changed the button from "Find Name" to "Find Ranking" to conform to instructions
	Added CSS to the alert dialog box

Version 1.5
	Fixed the freaking BlueJ stupidity. Turns out it was partially as a result of my unnecessarily making functions static.
		This caused the requirement of initial GUI element/variables to need to be static for global addressing. This in turn
		caused BlueJ to have convulsions and report that all kinds of thing were broken - all except the actual problem, that is.

Version 1.4
	Fixed an issue displaying year in the "All" output when name data is not present

Version 1.3
	Added CSS GUI styling

Version 1.2
	Added "All" year selection and back-end code for it
	Fixed a few more bugs

Version 1.1
	Added in some error checking, then fixed the new bugs associated with it

Version 1.0
	Search and reporting functions all working correctly

Version Alpha:
	Functioning GUI

Version Pre-Alpha:
	Development
